These files are used for Travis tests to test admin and user permissions:

couchdb.yml.admin:

  when activated, leap_web has admin permissions (e.g. ability to create
  databases, upload design docs).

couchdb.yml.user:

  when activited, leap_web has normal permissions (e.g. can modify all the
  records).

The term 'user' here is misleading. It is really two different types of admin
permissions.

Rails or rake must be run with 'test' environment for these configs to be
used.
